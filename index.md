I have been using angular along with angular material since 2015 because of the obvious reason that angular material is written in angular and it feels like a part of the framework. I don't feel that i am working on two different technologies, it's rather only angular with some prebuilt components available out of the box.

## Motivation for this post

Angular material is a great library but it is limited only to a set of components. There is no doubt that those components are written with great thought and they are highly flexible. They provide functionality which is neither less nor more than the intended.

But every frontend developer knows that there is much more required than just a toolkit of reusable components. 

We need: 
- Reusable CSS classes to size elements
- Reusable CSS classes to position elements on screen
- Reusable CSS utility classes for various properties like
   - display
   - visibility
   - position
   - padding
   - margin
   - width
   - and many more...
- A grid framework which is intutive and easy to understand and at the same time very robust.
- Rresponsive CSS utilities to adapts to the device width.

**All the above requirements point to one of the most famous design libraries i.e. `Bootstrap`**
